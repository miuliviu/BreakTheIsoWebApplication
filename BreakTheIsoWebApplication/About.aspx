    <h3><b>Break the ISO</b></h3>
    <p><i>Break the ISO</i> is a young, active, creative photography/videography team which operates in Bucharest Romania.
          The main interests of our digital media journey are focused on:
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li><i>Portraits</i></li>
            <li><i>Street Photography</i></li>
            <li><i>Weddings</i></li>
            <li><i>Landscapes and Nature</i></li>
</ul>
    </p>
    <p> Making memories and immortalising the vivid world around us is a way of living. As we get into this passion, our imagination and experience improved, thus the team members could pick which photography style suits them best.
        As time passed we wanted to share our vision with the people.
    </p>
    
    <p> As media footage is very important, our main  <i>goal</i> is to deliver quality and proffessional services.
     Photography is an art that is bounded only to imagination and that’s why we are  looking for new perspectives, concepts, ideas and designs. We want that every photography session to be well made and memorable.
